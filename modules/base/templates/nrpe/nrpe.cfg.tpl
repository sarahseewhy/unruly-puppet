# PID FILE
# The name of the file in which the NRPE daemon should write it's process ID
# number.  The file is only written if the NRPE daemon is started by the root
# user and is running in standalone mode.

# PORT NUMBER
# Port number we should wait for connections on.
# NOTE: This must be a non-privileged port (i.e. > 1024).
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd
# or xinetd or via systemd. [In systemd please use
# systemctl edit nrpe.service
# to set up the port.

# NRPE USER
# This determines the effective user that the NRPE daemon should run as.
# You can either supply a username or a UID.

# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd
# or xinetd or via systemd. [In systemd please use
# systemctl edit nrpe.service
# to set up the group.

# NRPE GROUP
# This determines the effective group that the NRPE daemon should run as.
# You can either supply a group name or a GID.

# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd
# or xinetd or via systemd. [In systemd please use
# systemctl edit nrpe.service
# to set up the user.

# ALLOWED HOST ADDRESSES
# This is an optional comma-delimited list of IP address or hostnames
# that are allowed to talk to the NRPE daemon. Network addresses with a bit mask
# (i.e. 192.168.1.0/24) are also supported. Hostname wildcards are not currently
# supported.
#
# Note: The daemon only does rudimentary checking of the client's IP
# address.  I would highly recommend adding entries in your /etc/hosts.allow
# file to allow only the specified host to connect to the port
# you are running this daemon on.
#
# NOTE: This option is ignored if NRPE is running under either inetd
# or xinetd or systemd

# COMMAND ARGUMENT PROCESSING
# This option determines whether or not the NRPE daemon will allow clients
# to specify arguments to commands that are executed.  This option only works
# if the daemon was configured with the --enable-command-args configure script
# option.

# of enabling this variable.

# BASH COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
# This option determines whether or not the NRPE daemon will allow clients
# to specify arguments that contain bash command substitutions of the form
# $(...).  This option only works if the daemon was configured with both
# the --enable-command-args and --enable-bash-command-substitution configure
# script options.

# *** ENABLING THIS OPTION IS A HIGH SECURITY RISK! ***

# This specifies the maximum number of seconds that the NRPE daemon will
# allow plugins to finish executing before killing them off.

command_timeout=60

# CONNECTION TIMEOUT
# This specifies the maximum number of seconds that the NRPE daemon will
# wait for a connection to be established before exiting. This is sometimes
# seen where a network problem stops the SSL being established even though
# all network sessions are connected. This causes the nrpe daemons to
# accumulate, eating system resources. Do not set this too low.
